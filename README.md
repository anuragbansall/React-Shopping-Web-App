<h3 align="center">React Shopping Web App</h3>

  <p align="center">
    This project is a basic e-commerce web application built with React.js and Tailwind CSS. It showcases product data in cards, allowing users to view details, add, delete, and edit products, with all data stored locally. While not a full-fledged e-commerce platform, this project served as a practice exercise to explore key React.js concepts such as useContext, dynamic routing, state management, and more. The app is designed for learning and experimentation, with features focused on managing product information rather than purchasing or cart functionality.
